# VoiceLoop - on-device Translation App with Gemma 3n

**VoiceLoop** is a privacy-first, offline translation app powered by Google's Gemma 3n that enables seamless multilingual communication through both traditional single-user translation and a "Mirror Mode" for real-time face-to-face conversations between two people speaking different languages.

## üåü Key Features

### üîÑ Two Translation Modes
- **Normal Mode**: Traditional single-user translation interface
- **Mirror Mode**: Face-to-face conversation interface where two people can interact naturally, with each person's interface optimally positioned for them

### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy-First Design
- **100% Offline**: All processing happens on-device using Gemma 3n
- **No Data Transmission**: Your conversations never leave your device
- **Local AI**: Powered by Google's Gemma 3n running entirely on your Android device

### üéôÔ∏è Multimodal Experience
- **Real-time Voice Recognition**: Speech-to-text 
- **Text-to-Speech**: Hear translations in natural voices
- **Text Input**: Manual text entry with live editing

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React Native + TypeScript)
- **Component Architecture**: Modular React components with custom hooks
- **State Management**: Centralized app state with optimized re-renders
- **Platform Integration**: Deep Android integration for native performance

### Backend (Native Android - Kotlin)
- **MediaPipe Integration**: Direct integration with Google's MediaPipe LLM Inference
- **Coroutine-based Processing**: Non-blocking async operations
- **Memory Optimization**: Intelligent cleanup and garbage collection

### AI Engine
- **Gemma 3n Integration**: Local on-device inference
- **Context Management**: Session isolation for accurate translations

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Model Installation

The app requires the Gemma 3n model file to be installed on your device at this specific location:
```
/data/local/tmp/llm/gemma3n.task
```

#### Steps to install the model:

1. **Download the model**: First, download the Gemma 3n `.task` file (e.g., from Kaggle)

2. **Install via ADB**: Use the following commands to install the model:
   ```bash
   # Remove existing model directory
   adb shell rm -r /data/local/tmp/llm/
   
   # Create the model directory
   adb shell mkdir -p /data/local/tmp/llm/
   
   # Push the model file to the device
   adb push your_model.task /data/local/tmp/llm/gemma3n.task
   ```

### 2. Language Packages Setup

VoiceLoop uses Android's built-in Google speech recognition and text-to-speech engines. You need to download language packages for the languages you want to use:

#### Speech-to-Text (STT) Language Packages:
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **General Management** ‚Üí **Google Voice Input**
2. Select **Download Languages**
3. Download the language packages you need

#### Text-to-Speech (TTS) Language Packages:
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **General Management** ‚Üí **Text-to-Speech**
2. Select **Google Speech Recognition and Synthesis** ‚Üí **Settings**
3. Select **Install Voice Data**
4. Download the language packages you need

### 3. App Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the app: `npx react-native run-android`

## ü§î Why Separate STT/TTS Modules?

### Audio Modality Limitation in MediaPipe Android

An important architectural decision in VoiceLoop was to use separate offline STT (Speech-to-Text) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) modules instead of relying on Gemma 3n's native audio capabilities. Here's why:

**MediaPipe Audio Inference Status**: As of the development time, MediaPipe's audio inference APIs for Android are not yet available in the Maven repository. While the audio modality is implemented in MediaPipe v0.10.26 (available on GitHub), the `tasks-genai` package with audio support has not been published to Maven, making it impossible to integrate audio inference directly with Gemma 3n in Android applications.

**Alternative Approaches Explored**:
- ‚ùå **MediaPipe v0.10.26**: Not published to Maven; building from source proved complex
- ‚ùå **LiteRT**: Requires `.tflite` files, which are not available for Gemma 3n
- ‚ùå **LiteRT Next**: Also requires `.tflite` files
- ‚ùå **LiteRT-LM**: No Kotlin/Android API support

**Our Solution**: Instead of waiting for MediaPipe's audio support, we implemented a robust architecture using:
- **Google's built-in STT engine**: Leverages Android's native speech recognition
- **Google's built-in TTS engine**: Uses Android's native text-to-speech synthesis
- **Gemma 3n for translation**: Handles the core translation logic with text-to-text processing

This approach ensures:
- ‚úÖ **Immediate availability**: Works with current MediaPipe releases
- ‚úÖ **High-quality audio processing**: Uses Google's mature STT/TTS engines
- ‚úÖ **Offline functionality**: All components work without internet
- ‚úÖ **Optimal performance**: Each component is optimized for its specific task
